       "   'row': {'article': 'additive models @xcite provide an important family of models for semiparametric regression or classification . some reasons for the success of additive models are their increased flexibility when compared to linear or generalized linear models and their increased interpretability when compared to fully nonparametric models .\\nit is well - known that good estimators in additive models are in general less prone to the curse of high dimensionality than good estimators in fully nonparametric models .\\nmany examples of such estimators belong to the large class of regularized kernel based methods over a reproducing kernel hilbert space @xmath0 , see e.g. @xcite . in the last years\\nmany interesting results on learning rates of regularized kernel based models for additive models have been published when the focus is on sparsity and when the classical least squares loss function is used , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein . of course , the least squares loss function is differentiable and has many nice mathematical properties , but it is only locally lipschitz continuous and therefore regularized kernel based methods based on this loss function typically suffer on bad statistical robustness properties , even if the kernel is bounded .\\nthis is in sharp contrast to kernel methods based on a lipschitz continuous loss function and on a bounded loss function , where results on upper bounds for the maxbias bias and on a bounded influence function are known , see e.g. @xcite for the general case and @xcite for additive models .\\ntherefore , we will here consider the case of regularized kernel based methods based on a general convex and lipschitz continuous loss function , on a general kernel , and on the classical regularizing term @xmath1 for some @xmath2 which is a smoothness penalty but not a sparsity penalty , see e.g. @xcite .\\nsuch regularized kernel based methods are now often called support vector machines ( svms ) , although the notation was historically used for such methods based on the special hinge loss function and for special kernels only , we refer to @xcite .    in this paper we address the open question , whether an svm with an additive kernel can provide a substantially better learning rate in high dimensions than an svm with a general kernel , say a classical gaussian rbf kernel , if the assumption of an additive model is satisfied .\\nour leading example covers learning rates for quantile regression based on the lipschitz continuous but non - differentiable pinball loss function , which is also called check function in the literature , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for parametric quantile regression and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for kernel based quantile regression .\\nwe will not address the question how to check whether the assumption of an additive model is satisfied because this would be a topic of a paper of its own .\\nof course , a practical approach might be to fit both models and compare their risks evaluated for test data .\\nfor the same reason we will also not cover sparsity .\\nconsistency of support vector machines generated by additive kernels for additive models was considered in @xcite . in this paper\\nwe establish learning rates for these algorithms .\\nlet us recall the framework with a complete separable metric space @xmath3 as the input space and a closed subset @xmath4 of @xmath5 as the output space .\\na borel probability measure @xmath6 on @xmath7 is used to model the learning problem and an independent and identically distributed sample @xmath8 is drawn according to @xmath6 for learning .\\na loss function @xmath9 is used to measure the quality of a prediction function @xmath10 by the local error @xmath11 .\\n_ throughout the paper we assume that @xmath12 is measurable , @xmath13 , convex with respect to the third variable , and uniformly lipschitz continuous satisfying @xmath14 with a finite constant @xmath15 .\\n_    support vector machines ( svms ) considered here are kernel - based regularization schemes in a reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) @xmath0 generated by a mercer kernel @xmath16 . with a shifted loss function @xmath17 introduced for dealing\\neven with heavy - tailed distributions as @xmath18 , they take the form @xmath19 where for a general borel measure @xmath20 on @xmath21 , the function @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a regularization parameter .\\nthe idea to shift a loss function has a long history , see e.g. @xcite in the context of m - estimators .\\nit was shown in @xcite that @xmath22 is also a minimizer of the following optimization problem involving the original loss function @xmath12 if a minimizer exists : @xmath25    the additive model we consider consists of the _ input space decomposition _\\n@xmath26 with each @xmath27 a complete separable metric space and a _ hypothesis space _\\n@xmath28 where @xmath29 is a set of functions @xmath30 each of which is also identified as a map @xmath31 from @xmath3 to @xmath5 .\\nhence the functions from @xmath32 take the additive form @xmath33 .\\nwe mention , that there is strictly speaking a notational problem here , because in the previous formula each quantity @xmath34 is an element of the set @xmath35 which is a subset of the full input space @xmath36 , @xmath37 , whereas in the definition of sample @xmath8 each quantity @xmath38 is an element of the full input space @xmath36 , where @xmath39 .\\nbecause these notations will only be used in different places and because we do not expect any misunderstandings , we think this notation is easier and more intuitive than specifying these quantities with different symbols .\\nthe additive kernel @xmath40 is defined in terms of mercer kernels @xmath41 on @xmath27 as @xmath42 it generates an rkhs @xmath0 which can be written in terms of the rkhs @xmath43 generated by @xmath41 on @xmath27 corresponding to the form ( [ additive ] ) as @xmath44 with norm given by @xmath45 the norm of @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47    to illustrate advantages of additive models , we provide two examples of

.\\nthe rest of the paper has the following structure .\\nsection [ ratessection ] contains our main results on learning rates for svms based on additive kernels . learning rates for quantile regression\\nare treated as important special cases .\\nsection [ comparisonsection ] contains a comparison of our results with other learning rates published recently .\\nsection [ proofsection ] contains all the proofs and some results which can be interesting in their own .\\nin this paper we provide some learning rates for the support vector machines generated by additive kernels for additive models which helps improve the quantitative understanding presented in @xcite .\\nthe rates are about asymptotic behaviors of the excess risk @xmath82 and take the form @xmath83 with @xmath84 .\\nthey will be stated under three kinds of conditions involving the hypothesis space @xmath0 , the measure @xmath6 , the loss @xmath12 , and the choice of the regularization parameter @xmath85 .\\nthe first condition is about the approximation ability of the hypothesis space @xmath0 .\\nsince the output function @xmath19 is from the hypothesis space , the learning rates of the learning algorithm depend on the approximation ability of the hypothesis space @xmath0 with respect to the optimal risk @xmath86 measured by the following approximation error .\\n[ defapprox ] the approximation error of the triple @xmath87 is defined as @xmath88    to estimate the approximation error , we make an assumption about the minimizer of the risk @xmath89    for each @xmath90 , define the integral operator @xmath91 associated with the kernel @xmath41 by @xmath92 we mention that @xmath93 is a compact and positive operator on @xmath94 . hence we can find its normalized eigenpairs @xmath95 such that @xmath96 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath94 and @xmath97 as @xmath98 . fix @xmath99 .\\nthen we can define the @xmath100-th power @xmath101 of @xmath93 by @xmath102 this is a positive and bounded operator and its range is well - defined .\\nthe assumption @xmath103 means @xmath104 lies in this range .\\n[ assumption1 ] we assume @xmath105 and @xmath106 where for some @xmath107 and each @xmath108 , @xmath109 is a function of the form @xmath110 with some @xmath111 .\\nthe case @xmath112 of assumption [ assumption1 ] means each @xmath113 lies in the rkhs @xmath43 .\\na standard condition in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) for achieving decays of the form @xmath114 for the approximation error ( [ approxerrordef ] ) is @xmath115 with some @xmath116 . here\\nthe operator @xmath117 is defined by @xmath118 in general , this can not be written in an additive form .\\nhowever , the hypothesis space ( [ additive ] ) takes an additive form @xmath119 .\\nso it is natural for us to impose an additive expression @xmath120 for the target function @xmath121 with the component functions @xmath113 satisfying the power condition @xmath110 .\\nthe above natural assumption leads to a technical difficulty in estimating the approximation error : the function @xmath113 has no direct connection to the marginal distribution @xmath122 projected onto @xmath27 , hence existing methods in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) can not be applied directly .\\nnote that on the product space @xmath123 , there is no natural probability measure projected from @xmath6 , and the risk on @xmath124 is not defined .    our idea to overcome the difficulty is to introduce an intermediate function @xmath125 .\\nit may not minimize a risk ( which is not even defined ) .\\nhowever , it approximates the component function @xmath113 well .\\nwhen we add up such functions @xmath126 , we get a good approximation of the target function @xmath121 , and thereby a good estimate of the approximation error .\\nthis is the first novelty of the paper .\\n[ approxerrorthm ] under assumption [ assumption1 ] , we have @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the constant given by @xmath129      the second condition for our learning rates is about the capacity of the hypothesis space measured by @xmath130-empirical covering numbers .    let @xmath131 be a set of functions on @xmath21 and @xmath132 for every @xmath133 the * covering number of @xmath131 * with respect to the empirical metric @xmath134 , given by @xmath135 is defined as @xmath136 and the * @xmath130-empirical covering number * of @xmath137 is defined as @xmath138    [ assumption2 ] we assume @xmath139 and that for some @xmath140 , @xmath141 and every @xmath142 , the @xmath130-empirical covering number of the unit ball of @xmath43 satisfies @xmath143    the second novelty of this paper is to observe that the additive nature of the hypothesis space yields the following nice bound with a dimension - independent power exponent for the covering numbers of the balls of the hypothesis space @xmath0 , to be proved in section [ samplesection ] .\\n[ capacitythm ] under assumption [ assumption2 ] , for any @xmath144 and @xmath145 , we have @xmath146    the bound for the covering numbers stated in theorem [ capacitythm ] is special : the power @xmath147 is independent of the number @xmath148 of the components in the additive model .\\nit is well - known @xcite in the literature of function spaces that the covering numbers of balls of the sobolev space @xmath149 on the cube @xmath150^s$ ] of the euclidean space @xmath151 with regularity index @xmath152 has the following asymptotic behavior with @xmath153 : @xmath154 here the power @xmath155 depends linearly on the dimension @xmath148 .\\nsimilar dimension - dependent bounds for the covering numbers of the rkhss associated with gaussian rbf - kernels can be found in @xcite .\\nthe special bound in theorem [ capacitythm ] demonstrates an advantage of the additive model in terms of capacity of the additive hypothesis space .\\nthe third condition for our learning rates is about the noise level in the measure @xmath6 with respect to the hypothesis space . before stating the general condition\\n, we consider a special case for quantile regression , to illustrate our general results .\\nlet @xmath156 be a quantile parameter .\\nthe quantile regression function @xmath157 is defined by its value @xmath158 to be a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath160 , i.e. , a value @xmath161 satisfying @xmath162 the regularization scheme for quantile regression considered here takes the form ( [ algor ] ) with the loss function @xmath12 given by the pinball loss as @xmath163    a noise condition on @xmath6 for quantile regression is defined in @xcite as follows . to this end , let @xmath164 be a probability measure on @xmath165 and @xmath166 . then a real number @xmath167 is called @xmath159-quantile of

function @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the constant defined in part ( 1 ) , satisfies @xmath182 .\\none can show that a distribution @xmath164 having a @xmath159-quantile of type @xmath170 has a unique @xmath159-quantile @xmath183 .\\nmoreover , if @xmath164 has a lebesgue density @xmath184 then @xmath164 has a @xmath159-quantile of type @xmath170 if @xmath184 is bounded away from zero on @xmath185

@xmath187 , and logistic distributions ( with @xmath188 ) , gamma and log - normal distributions ( with @xmath189 ) , and uniform and beta distributions ( with @xmath190 $ ] ) .\\nthe following theorem , to be proved in section [ proofsection ] , gives a learning rate for the regularization scheme ( [ algor ] ) in the special case of quantile regression .\\n[ quantilethm ] suppose that @xmath191 almost surely for some constant @xmath192 , and that each kernel @xmath41 is @xmath193 with @xmath194 for some @xmath195 .\\nif assumption [ assumption1 ] holds with @xmath112 and @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 for some @xmath196 $ ] , then by taking @xmath197 , for any @xmath198 and @xmath199 , with confidence at least @xmath200 we have @xmath201 where @xmath202 is a constant independent of @xmath203 and @xmath204 and @xmath205    please note that the exponent @xmath206 given by ( [ quantilerates2 ] ) for the learning rate in ( [ quantilerates ] ) is independent of the quantile level @xmath159 , of the number @xmath148 of additive components in @xmath207 , and of the dimensions @xmath208 and @xmath209 further note that @xmath210 , if @xmath211 , and @xmath212 if @xmath213 . because @xmath214 can be arbitrarily close to @xmath215 , the learning rate , which is independent of the dimension @xmath216 and given by theorem [ quantilethm ] , is close to @xmath217 for large values of @xmath177 and is close to @xmath218 or better , if @xmath211 .      to state our general learning rates\\n, we need an assumption on a _ variance - expectation bound _ which is similar to definition [ noisecond ] in the special case of quantile regression .\\n[ assumption3 ] we assume that there exist an exponent @xmath219 $ ] and a positive constant @xmath220 such that @xmath221    assumption [ assumption3 ] always holds true for @xmath222 . if the triple @xmath223 satisfies some conditions , the exponent @xmath224 can be larger .\\nfor example , when @xmath12 is the pinball loss ( [ pinloss ] ) and @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath225 for some @xmath196 $ ] and @xmath226 as defined in @xcite , then @xmath227 .\\n[ mainratesthm ] suppose that @xmath228 is bounded by a constant @xmath229 almost surely . under assumptions [ assumption1 ] to [ assumption3 ] ,\\nif we take @xmath198 and @xmath230 for some @xmath231 , then for any @xmath232 , with confidence at least @xmath200 we have @xmath233 where @xmath234 is given by @xmath235 and @xmath202 is constant independent of @xmath203 or @xmath204 ( to be given explicitly in the proof ) .\\nwe now add some theoretical and numerical comparisons on the goodness of our learning rates with those from the literature . as already mentioned in the introduction\\n, some reasons for the popularity of additive models are flexibility , increased interpretability , and ( often ) a reduced proneness of the curse of high dimensions .\\nhence it is important to check , whether the learning rate given in theorem [ mainratesthm ] under the assumption of an additive model favourably compares to ( essentially ) optimal learning rates without this assumption . in other words ,\\nwe need to demonstrate that the main goal of this paper is achieved by theorem [ quantilethm ] and theorem [ mainratesthm ] , i.e. that an svm based on an additive kernel can provide a substantially better learning rate in high dimensions than an svm with a general kernel , say a classical gaussian rbf kernel , provided the assumption of an additive model is satisfied .\\nour learning rate in theorem [ quantilethm ] is new and optimal in the literature of svm for quantile regression .\\nmost learning rates in the literature of svm for quantile regression are given for projected output functions @xmath236 , while it is well known that projections improve learning rates @xcite . here the projection operator @xmath237 is defined for any measurable function @xmath10 by @xmath238 sometimes this is called clipping .\\nsuch results are given in @xcite .\\nfor example , under the assumptions that @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 , the approximation error condition ( [ approxerrorb ] ) is satisfied for some @xmath239 , and that for some constants @xmath240 , the sequence of eigenvalues @xmath241 of the integral operator @xmath117 satisfies @xmath242 for every @xmath243 , it was shown in @xcite that with confidence at least @xmath200 , @xmath244 where @xmath245 here the parameter @xmath246 measures the capacity of the rkhs @xmath247 and it plays a similar role as half of the parameter @xmath147 in assumption 2 . for a @xmath193 kernel and @xmath112\\n, one can choose @xmath246 and @xmath147 to be arbitrarily small and the above power index @xmath248 can be taken as @xmath249 .\\nthe learning rate in theorem [ quantilethm ] may be improved by relaxing assumption 1 to a sobolev smoothness condition for @xmath121 and a regularity condition for the marginal distribution @xmath250 .\\nfor example , one may use a gaussian kernel @xmath251 depending on the sample size @xmath203 and @xcite achieve the approximation error condition ( [ approxerrorb ] ) for some @xmath252 .\\nthis is done for quantile regression in @xcite .\\nsince we are mainly interested in additive models , we shall not discuss such an extension .\\n[ gaussmore ] let @xmath48 , @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath50 ^ 2.$ ] let @xmath51 and the additive kernel @xmath72 be given by ( [ gaussaddform ] ) with @xmath253 in

whether the above learning rate can be derived by existing approaches in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) even after projection .\\nnote that the kernel in the above example is independent of the sample size .\\nit would be interesting to see whether there exists some @xmath99 such that the function @xmath57 defined by ( [ gaussfcn ] ) lies in the range of the operator @xmath254 .\\nthe existence of such a positive index would lead to the approximation error condition ( [ approxerrorb ] ) , see @xcite .    let us now add some numerical comparisons on the goodness of our learning rates given by theorem [ mainratesthm ] with those given by @xcite .\\ntheir corollary 4.12 gives ( essentially ) minmax optimal learning rates for ( clipped ) svms in the context of nonparametric quantile regression using one gaussian rbf kernel on the whole input space under appropriate smoothness assumptions of the target function .\\nlet us consider the case that the distribution @xmath6 has a @xmath159-quantile of @xmath177-average type @xmath170 , where @xmath255 , and assume that both corollary 4.12 in @xcite and our theorem [ mainratesthm ] are applicable .\\ni.e. , we assume in

       "   'row': {'article': 'the transport properties of nonlinear non - equilibrium dynamical systems are far from well - understood@xcite .\\nconsider in particular so - called ratchet systems which are asymmetric periodic potentials where an ensemble of particles experience directed transport@xcite .\\nthe origins of the interest in this lie in considerations about extracting useful work from unbiased noisy fluctuations as seems to happen in biological systems@xcite .\\nrecently attention has been focused on the behavior of deterministic chaotic ratchets@xcite as well as hamiltonian ratchets@xcite .\\nchaotic systems are defined as those which are sensitively dependent on initial conditions . whether chaotic or not , the behavior of nonlinear systems  including the transition from regular to chaotic behavior  is in general sensitively dependent on the parameters of the system .\\nthat is , the phase - space structure is usually relatively complicated , consisting of stability islands embedded in chaotic seas , for examples , or of simultaneously co - existing attractors .\\nthis can change significantly as parameters change .\\nfor example , stability islands can merge into each other , or break apart , and the chaotic sea itself may get pinched off or otherwise changed , or attractors can change symmetry or bifurcate .\\nthis means that the transport properties can change dramatically as well .\\na few years ago , mateos@xcite considered a specific ratchet model with a periodically forced underdamped particle .\\nhe looked at an ensemble of particles , specifically the velocity for the particles , averaged over time and the entire ensemble .\\nhe showed that this quantity , which is an intuitively reasonable definition of ` the current \\' , could be either positive or negative depending on the amplitude @xmath0 of the periodic forcing for the system . at the same time , there exist ranges in @xmath0 where the trajectory of an individual particle displays chaotic dynamics .\\nmateos conjectured a connection between these two phenomena , specifically that the reversal of current direction was correlated with a bifurcation from chaotic to periodic behavior in the trajectory dynamics .\\neven though it is unlikely that such a result would be universally valid across all chaotic deterministic ratchets , it would still be extremely useful to have general heuristic rules such as this .\\nthese organizing principles would allow some handle on characterizing the many different kinds of behavior that are possible in such systems .\\na later investigation@xcite of the mateos conjecture by barbi and salerno , however , argued that it was not a valid rule even in the specific system considered by mateos .\\nthey presented results showing that it was possible to have current reversals in the absence of bifurcations from periodic to chaotic behavior .\\nthey proposed an alternative origin for the current reversal , suggesting it was related to the different stability properties of the rotating periodic orbits of the system .\\nthese latter results seem fundamentally sensible . however , this paper based its arguments about currents on the behavior of a _ single _ particle as opposed to an ensemble .\\nthis implicitly assumes that the dynamics of the system are ergodic .\\nthis is not true in general for chaotic systems of the type being considered . in particular , there can be extreme dependence of the result on the statistics of the ensemble being considered .\\nthis has been pointed out in earlier studies  @xcite which laid out a detailed methodology for understanding transport properties in such a mixed regular and chaotic system . depending on specific parameter value , the particular system under consideration has multiple coexisting periodic or chaotic attractors or a mixture of both .\\nit is hence appropriate to understand how a probability ensemble might behave in such a system .\\nthe details of the dependence on the ensemble are particularly relevant to the issue of the possible experimental validation of these results , since experiments are always conducted , by virtue of finite - precision , over finite time and finite ensembles .\\nit is therefore interesting to probe the results of barbi and salerno with regard to the details of the ensemble used , and more formally , to see how ergodicity alters our considerations about the current , as we do in this paper .\\nwe report here on studies on the properties of the current in a chaotic deterministic ratchet , specifically the same system as considered by mateos@xcite and barbi and salerno@xcite .\\nwe consider the impact of different kinds of ensembles of particles on the current and show that the current depends significantly on the details of the initial ensemble .\\nwe also show that it is important to discard transients in quantifying the current .\\nthis is one of the central messages of this paper : broad heuristics are rare in chaotic systems , and hence it is critical to understand the ensemble - dependence in any study of the transport properties of chaotic ratchets .\\nhaving established this , we then proceed to discuss the connection between the bifurcation diagram for individual particles and the behavior of the current .\\nwe find that while we disagree with many of the details of barbi and salerno s results , the broader conclusion still holds .\\nthat is , it is indeed possible to have current reversals in the absence of bifurcations from chaos to periodic behavior as well as bifurcations without any accompanying current reversals .\\nthe result of our investigation is therefore that the transport properties of a chaotic ratchet are not as simple as the initial conjecture .\\nhowever , we do find evidence for a generalized version of mateos s conjecture .\\nthat is , in general , bifurcations for trajectory dynamics as a function of system parameter seem to be associated with abrupt changes in the current .\\ndepending on the specific value of the current , these abrupt changes may lead the net current to reverse direction , but not necessarily so .\\nwe start below with a preparatory discussion necessary to understand the details of the connection between bifurcations and current reversal , where we discuss the potential and phase - space for single trajectories for this system , where we also define a bifurcation diagram for this system . in the next section ,\\nwe discuss the subtleties of establishing a connection between the behavior of individual trajectories and of ensembles .\\nafter this , we are able to compare details of specific trajectory bifurcation curves with current curves , and thus justify our broader statements above , after which we conclude .\\nthe goal of these studies is to understand the behavior of general chaotic ratchets .\\nthe approach taken here is that to discover heuristic rules we must consider specific systems in great detail before generalizing .\\nwe choose the same @xmath1-dimensional ratchet considered previously by mateos@xcite , as well as barbi and salerno@xcite .\\nwe consider an ensemble of particles moving in an asymmetric periodic potential , driven by a periodic time - dependent external force , where the force has a zero time - average .\\nthere is no noise in the system , so it is completely deterministic , although there is damping .\\nthe equations of motion for an individual trajectory for such a system are given in dimensionless variables by @xmath2 where the periodic asymmetric potential can be written in the form @xmath3 + \\\\frac{1}{4 } \\\\sin [ 4\\\\pi ( x -x_0 ) ] \\\\bigg ] .\\\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath4 have been introduced for convenience such that one potential minimum exists at the origin with @xmath5 and the term @xmath6 .\\n( a ) classical phase space for the unperturbed system . for @xmath7 , @xmath8 ,\\ntwo chaotic attractors emerge with @xmath9 ( b ) @xmath10 ( c ) and a period four attractor consisting of the four centers of the circles with @xmath11.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    the phase - space of the undamped undriven ratchet  the system corresponding to the unperturbed potential @xmath12  looks like a series of asymmetric pendula .\\nthat is , individual trajectories have one of following possible time - asymptotic behaviors : ( i ) inside the potential wells , trajectories and all their properties oscillate , leading to zero net transport . outside the wells , the trajectories either ( ii ) librate to the right or ( iii ) to the left , with corresponding net transport depending upon initial conditions .\\nthere are also ( iv ) trajectories on the separatrices between the oscillating and librating orbits , moving between unstable fixed points in infinite time , as well as the unstable and stable fixed points themselves , all of which constitute a set of negligible measure .    when damping is introduced via the @xmath13-dependent term in eq .\\n[ eq : dyn ] , it makes the stable fixed points the only attractors for the system .\\nwhen the driving is turned on , the phase - space becomes chaotic with the usual phenomena of intertwining separatrices and resulting homoclinic tangles .\\nthe dynamics of individual trajectories in such a system are now very complicated in general and depend sensitively on the choice of parameters and initial conditions .\\nwe show snapshots of the development of this kind of chaos in the set of poincar sections fig .\\n( [ figure1]b , c ) together with a period - four orbit represented by the center of the circles .    a broad characterization of the dynamics of the problem as a function of a parameter ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) emerges in a bifurcation diagram\\n. this can be constructed in several different and essentially equivalent ways .\\nthe relatively standard form that we use proceeds as follows : first choose the bifurcation parameter ( let us say @xmath0 ) and correspondingly choose fixed values of @xmath16 , and start with a given value for @xmath17 .\\nnow iterate an initial condition , recording the value of the particle s position @xmath18 at times @xmath19 from its integrated trajectory ( sometimes we record @xmath20 .\\nthis is done stroboscopically at discrete times @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is an integer @xmath24 with @xmath25 the maximum number of observations made . of these , discard observations at times less than some cut - off time @xmath26 and plot the remaining points against @xmath27 .\\nit must be noted that discarding transient behavior is critical to get results which are independent of initial condition , and we shall emphasize this further below in the context of the net transport or current .\\nif the system has a fixed - point attractor then all of the data lie at one particular location @xmath28 . a periodic orbit with period @xmath29 ( that is , with period commensurate with the driving ) shows up with @xmath30 points occupying only @xmath31 different locations of @xmath32 for @xmath27 .\\nall other orbits , including periodic orbits of incommensurate period result in a simply - connected or multiply - connected dense set of points . for the next value @xmath33 , the last computed value of @xmath34 at @xmath35 are used as initial conditions , and previously , results are stored after cutoff and so on until @xmath36 .\\nthat is , the bifurcation diagram is generated by sweeping the relevant parameter , in this case @xmath0 , from @xmath27 through some maximum value @xmath37 .\\nthis procedure is intended to catch all coexisting attractors of the system with the specified parameter range .\\nnote that several initial conditions are effectively used troughout the process , and a bifurcation diagram is not the behavior of a single trajectory .\\nwe have made several plots , as a test , with different initial conditions and the diagrams obtained are identical .\\nwe show several examples of this kind of bifurcation diagram below , where they are being compared with the corresponding behavior of the current .\\nhaving broadly understood the wide range of behavior for individual trajectories in this system , we now turn in the next section to a discussion of the non - equilibrium properties of a statistical ensemble of these trajectories , specifically the current for an ensemble .\\nthe current @xmath38 for an ensemble in the system is defined in an intuitive manner by mateos@xcite as the time - average of the average velocity over an ensemble of initial conditions .\\nthat is , an average over several initial conditions is performed at a given observation time @xmath39 to yield the average velocity over the particles @xmath40 this average velocity is then further time - averaged ; given the discrete time @xmath39 for observation this leads to a second sum @xmath41 where @xmath25 is the number of time - observations made .    for this to be a relevant quantity to compare with bifurcation diagrams , @xmath38 should be independent of the quantities @xmath42 but still strongly dependent on @xmath43 .\\na further parameter dependence that is being suppressed in the definition above is the shape and location of the ensemble being used .\\nthat is , the transport properties of an ensemble in a chaotic system depend in general on the part of the phase - space being sampled .\\nit is therefore important to consider many different initial conditions to generate a current . the first straightforward result we show in fig .\\n( [ figure2 ] ) is that in the case of chaotic trajectories , a single trajectory easily displays behavior very different from that of many trajectories .\\nhowever , it turns out that in the regular regime , it is possible to use a single trajectory to get essentially the same result as obtained from many trajectories .    further consider the bifurcation diagram in fig .\\n( [ figure3 ] ) where we superimpose the different curves resulting from varying the number of points in the initial ensemble .\\nfirst , the curve is significantly smoother as a function of @xmath0 for larger @xmath44 . even more relevant is the fact that the single trajectory data ( @xmath45 ) may show current reversals that do not exist in the large @xmath44 data .\\ncurrent @xmath38 versus the number of trajectories @xmath44 for @xmath7 ; dashed lines correspond to a regular motion with @xmath46 while solid lines correspond to a chaotic motion with @xmath47 .\\nnote that a single trajectory is sufficient for a regular motion while the convergence in the chaotic case is only obtained if the @xmath44 exceeds a certain threshold , @xmath48.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]     current @xmath38 versus @xmath0 for different set of trajectories @xmath44 ; @xmath45 ( circles ) , @xmath49 ( square ) and @xmath50 ( dashed lines ) . note that a single trajectory suffices in the regular regime where all the curves match . in the chaotic regime\\n, as @xmath44 increases , the curves converge towards the dashed one.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    also , note that single - trajectory current values are typically significantly greater than ensemble averages .\\nthis arises from the fact that an arbitrarily chosen ensemble has particles with idiosyncratic behaviors which often average out . as our result , with these ensembles we see typical @xmath51 for example , while barbi and salerno report currents about @xmath52 times greater .\\nhowever , it is not true that only a few trajectories dominate the dynamics completely , else there would not be a saturation of the current as a function of @xmath44 .\\nall this is clear in fig .\\n( [ figure3 ] ) .\\nwe note that the * net * drift of an ensemble can be a lot closer to @xmath53 than the behavior of an individual trajectory\\n.    it should also be clear that there is a dependence of the current on the location of the initial ensemble , this being particularly true for small @xmath44 , of course .\\nthe location is defined by its centroid @xmath54 . for @xmath45 , it is trivially true that the initial location matters to the asymptotic value of the time - averaged velocity , given that this is a non - ergodic and chaotic system .\\nfurther , considering a gaussian ensemble , say , the width of the ensemble also affects the details of the current , and can show , for instance , illusory current reversal , as seen in figs .\\n( [ current - bifur1],[current - bifur2 ] ) for example .\\nnotice also that in fig .\\n( [ current - bifur1 ] ) , at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the deviations between the different ensembles is particularly pronounced .\\nthese points are close to bifurcation points where some sort of symmetry breaking is clearly occuring , which underlines our emphasis on the relevance of specifying ensemble characteristics in the neighborhood of unstable behavior .\\nhowever , why these specific bifurcations should stand out among all the bifurcations in the parameter range shown is not entirely clear .    to understand how to incorporate this knowledge into calculations of the current ,\\ntherefore , consider the fact that if we look at the classical phase space for the hamiltonian or underdamped @xmath57 motion , we see the typical structure of stable islands embedded in a chaotic sea which have quite complicated behavior@xcite . in such a situation , the dynamics always depends on the location of the initial conditions .\\nhowever , we are not in the hamiltonian situation when the damping is turned on  in this case , the phase - space consists in general of attractors .\\nthat is , if transient behavior is discarded , the current is less likely to depend significantly on the location of the initial conditions or on the spread of the initial conditions .    in particular , in the chaotic regime of a non - hamiltonian system , the initial ensemble needs to be chosen larger than a certain threshold to ensure convergence .\\nhowever , in the regular regime , it is not important to take a large ensemble and a single trajectory can suffice , as long as we take care to discard the transients .\\nthat is to say , in the computation of currents , the definition of the current needs to be modified to : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is some empirically obtained cut - off such that we get a converged current ( for instance , in our calculations , we obtained converged results with @xmath60 ) . when this modified form is used , the convergence ( ensemble - independence ) is more rapid as a function of @xmath61 and the width of the intial conditions .\\narmed with this background , we are now finally in a position to compare bifurcation diagrams with the current , as we do in the next section .\\nour results are presented in the set of figures fig .\\n( [ figure5 ] )  fig .\\n( [ rev - nobifur ] ) , in each of which we plot both the ensemble current and the bifurcation diagram as a function of the parameter @xmath0 .\\nthe main point of these numerical results can be distilled into a series of heuristic statements which we state below ; these are labelled with roman numerals .     for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , we plot current ( upper ) with @xmath62 and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0 .\\nnote that there is a * single * current reversal while there are many bifurcations visible in the same parameter range.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    consider fig .\\n( [ figure5 ] ) , which shows the parameter range @xmath63 chosen relatively arbitrarily . in this figure , we see several period - doubling bifurcations leading to order - chaos transitions , such as for example in the approximate ranges @xmath64 . however , there is only one instance of current - reversal , at @xmath65 .\\nnote , however , that the current is not without structure  it changes fairly dramatically as a function of parameter .\\nthis point is made even more clearly in fig .\\n( [ figure6 ] ) where the current remains consistently below @xmath53 , and hence there are in fact , no current reversals at all .\\nnote again , however , that the current has considerable structure , even while remaining negative\\n.     for @xmath66 and @xmath8 , plotted are current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0 with @xmath62 .\\nnotice the current stays consistently below @xmath53.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]     current and bifurcations versus @xmath0 . in ( a ) and ( b )\\nwe show ensemble dependence , specifically in ( a ) the black curve is for an ensemble of trajectories starting centered at the stable fixed point @xmath67 with a root - mean - square gaussian width of @xmath68 , and the brown curve for trajectories starting from the unstable fixed point @xmath69 and of width @xmath68 . in ( b ) , all ensembles are centered at the stable fixed point , the black line for an ensemble of width @xmath68 , brown a width of @xmath70 and maroon with width @xmath71 .\\n( c ) is the comparison of the current @xmath38 without transients ( black ) and with transients ( brown ) along with the single - trajectory results in blue ( after barbi and salerno ) .\\nthe initial conditions for the ensembles are centered at @xmath67 with a mean root square gaussian of width @xmath68 .\\n( d ) is the corresponding bifurcation diagram.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    it is possible to find several examples of this at different parameters , leading to the negative conclusion , therefore , that * ( i ) not all bifurcations lead to current reversal*. however , we are searching for positive correlations , and at this point we have not precluded the more restricted statement that all current reversals are associated with bifurcations , which is in fact mateos conjecture .\\nwe therefore now move onto comparing our results against the specific details of barbi and salerno s treatment of this conjecture . in particular , we look at their figs .\\n( 2,3a,3b ) , where they scan the parameter region @xmath72 .\\nthe distinction between their results and ours is that we are using _\\nensembles _ of particles , and are investigating the convergence of these results as a function of number of particles @xmath44 , the width of the ensemble in phase - space , as well as transience parameters @xmath73 .    our data with larger @xmath44 yields different results in general , as we show in the recomputed versions of these figures , presented here in figs .\\n( [ current - bifur1],[current - bifur2 ] ) .\\nspecifically , ( a ) the single - trajectory results are , not surprisingly , cleaner and can be more easily interpreted as part of transitions in the behavior of the stability properties of the periodic orbits .\\nthe ensemble results on the other hand , even when converged , show statistical roughness .\\n( b ) the ensemble results are consistent with barbi and salerno in general , although disagreeing in several details .\\nfor instance , ( c ) the bifurcation at @xmath74 has a much gentler impact on the ensemble current , which has been growing for a while , while the single - trajectory result changes abruptly . note , ( d ) the very interesting fact that the single - trajectory current completely misses the bifurcation - associated spike at @xmath75 .\\nfurther , ( e ) the barbi and salerno discussion of the behavior of the current in the range @xmath76 is seen to be flawed \\nour results are consistent with theirs , however , the current changes are seen to be consistent with bifurcations despite their statements to the contrary . on the other hand ( f ) , the ensemble current shows a case [ in fig .\\n( [ current - bifur2 ] ) , at @xmath77 of current reversal that does not seem to be associated with bifurcations .\\nin this spike , the current abruptly drops below @xmath53 and then rises above it again .\\nthe single trajectory current completely ignores this particular effect , as can be seen .\\nthe bifurcation diagram indicates that in this case the important transitions happen either before or after the spike .\\nall of this adds up to two statements : the first is a reiteration of the fact that there is significant information in the ensemble current that can not be obtained from the single - trajectory current .\\nthe second is that the heuristic that arises from this is again a negative conclusion , that * ( ii ) not all current reversals are associated with bifurcations .\\n* where does this leave us in the search for ` positive \\' results , that is , useful heuristics ?\\none possible way of retaining the mateos conjecture is to weaken it , i.e. make it into the statement that * ( iii ) _ most _ current reversals are associated with bifurcations . *     same as fig .\\n( [ current - bifur1 ] ) except for the range of @xmath0 considered.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]     for @xmath78 and @xmath8 , plotted are current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0 with @xmath62 .\\nnote in particular in this figure that eyeball tests can be misleading .\\nwe see reversals without bifurcations in ( a ) whereas the zoomed version ( c ) shows that there are windows of periodic and chaotic regimes .\\nthis is further evidence that jumps in the current correspond in general to bifurcation.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]     for @xmath7 and @xmath79 , current ( upper ) and bifurcation diagram ( lower ) versus @xmath0.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    however , a * different * rule of thumb , previously not proposed , emerges from our studies .\\nthis generalizes mateos conjecture to say that * ( iv ) bifurcations correspond to sudden current changes ( spikes or jumps)*. note that this means these changes in current are not necessarily reversals of direction .\\nif this current jump or spike goes through zero , this coincides with a current reversal , making the mateos conjecture a special case .\\nthe physical basis of this argument is the fact that ensembles of particles in chaotic systems _ can _ have net directed transport but the details of this behavior depends relatively sensitively on the system parameters .\\nthis parameter dependence is greatly exaggerated at the bifurcation point , when the dynamics of the underlying single - particle system undergoes a transition  a period - doubling transition , for example , or one from chaos to regular behavior .\\nscanning the relevant figures , we see that this is a very useful rule of thumb . for example\\n, it completely captures the behaviour of fig .\\n( [ figure6 ] ) which can not be understood as either an example of the mateos conjecture , or even a failure thereof . as such\\n, this rule significantly enhances our ability to characterize changes in the behavior of the current as a function of parameter .\\na further example of where this modified conjecture helps us is in looking at a seeming negation of the mateos conjecture , that is , an example where we seem to see current - reversal without bifurcation , visible in fig .\\n( [ hidden - bifur ] ) .\\nthe current - reversals in that scan of parameter space seem to happen inside the chaotic regime and seemingly independent of bifurcation . however , this turns out to be a ` hidden \\' bifurcation  when we zoom in on the chaotic regime , we see hidden periodic windows .\\nthis is therefore consistent with our statement that sudden current changes are associated with bifurcations .\\neach of the transitions from periodic behavior to chaos and back provides opportunities for the current to spike .\\nhowever , in not all such cases can these hidden bifurcations be found .\\nwe can see an example of this in fig .\\n( [ rev - nobifur ] ) .\\nthe current is seen to move smoothly across @xmath80 with seemingly no corresponding bifurcations , even when we do a careful zoom on the data , as in fig .\\n( [ hidden - bifur ] ) .\\nhowever , arguably , although subjective , this change is close to the bifurcation point .\\nthis result , that there are situations where the heuristics simply do not seem to apply , are part of the open questions associated with this problem , of course .\\nwe note , however , that we have seen that these broad arguments hold when we vary other parameters as well ( figures not shown here ) .    in conclusion ,\\nin this paper we have taken the approach that it is useful to find general rules of thumb ( even if not universally valid ) to understand the complicated behavior of non - equilibrium nonlinear statistical mechanical systems . in the case of chaotic deterministic ratchets\\n, we have shown that it is important to factor out issues of size , location , spread , and transience in computing the ` current \\' due to an ensemble before we search for such rules , and that the dependence on ensemble characteristics is most critical near certain bifurcation points .\\nwe have then argued that the following heuristic characteristics hold : bifurcations in single - trajectory behavior often corresponds to sudden spikes or jumps in the current for an ensemble in the same system .\\ncurrent reversals are a special case of this\\n. however , not all spikes or jumps correspond to a bifurcation , nor vice versa .\\nthe open question is clearly to figure out if the reason for when these rules are violated or are valid can be made more concrete .\\na.k . gratefully acknowledges t. barsch and kamal p. singh for stimulating discussions , the reimar lst grant and financial support from the alexander von humboldt foundation in bonn . a.k.p .\\nis grateful to carleton college for the ` sit , wallin , and class of 1949 \\' sabbatical fellowships , and to the mpipks for hosting him for a sabbatical visit , which led to this collaboration .\\nuseful discussions with j .-\\nm . rost on preliminary results are also acknowledged .\\np. hnggi and bartussek , in nonlinear physics of complex systems , lecture notes in physics vol .\\n476 , edited by j. parisi , s.c .\\nmueller , and w. zimmermann ( springer verlag , berlin , 1996 ) , pp.294 -

and ( ii ) the characteristic time of phase variations , @xmath2 , should be much smaller than the integration time , @xmath3 , of the detector .\\nhowever , only limiting cases @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been considered in the literature .\\n( see , for example , refs .\\n@xcite,@xcite and ref .\\n@xcite , respectively ) .\\nit is evident that the inequality @xmath6 can be easily satisfied by choosing a detector with very long integration time . at the same time\\n, this kind of the detector can not distinguish different signals within the interval @xmath3 .\\nthis means that the resolution of the receiving system might become too low for the case of large @xmath3 . on the other hand\\n, there is a technical restriction on phase diffusers : up to now their characteristic times , @xmath2 , are not smaller than @xmath7 . besides that , in some specific cases ( see , for example , ref .\\n@xcite ) , the spectral broadening of laser radiation due to the phase diffuser ( @xmath8 ) may become unacceptably high .\\nthe factors mentioned above impose serious restrictions on the physical characteristics of phase diffusers which could be potentially useful for suppressing the intensity fluctuations .\\nan adequate choice of diffusers may be facilitated if we know in detail the effect of finite - time phase variation , introduced by them , on the photon statistics . in this case\\n, it is possible to control the performance of communication systems . in what follows , we will obtain theoretically the dependence of scintillation index on @xmath9 without any restrictions on the value of this ratio\\nthis is the main purpose of our paper .\\nfurther analysis is based on the formalism developed in ref .\\n@xcite and modified here to understand the case of finite - time dynamics of the phase diffuser .\\nthe detectors of the absorbed type do not sense the instantaneous intensity of electromagnetic waves @xmath10 .\\nthey sense the intensity averaged over some finite interval @xmath3 i.e. @xmath11 usually , the averaging time @xmath3 ( the integration time of the detector ) is much smaller than the characteristic time of the turbulence variation , @xmath12 , ( @xmath13 ) .\\ntherefore , the average value of the intensity can be obtained by further averaging of eq .\\n[ one ] over many measurements corresponding various realizations of the refractive - index configurations .\\nthe scintillation index determining the mean - square fluctuations of the intensity is defined by @xmath14\\\\bigg /\\\\big\\n< \\\\bar{i}\\\\big > ^2=\\n\\\\frac{\\\\big < : \\\\bar i(t ) ^2:\\\\big>}{\\\\big<\\\\bar i \\\\big>^2}-1,\\\\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath15 indicates the normal ordering of the creation and annihilation operators which determine the intensity , @xmath10 .\\n( see more details in refs .\\n@xcite,@xcite ) . the brackets @xmath16 indicate quantum - mechanical and atmospheric averagings .\\nthe intensity @xmath17 depends not only on @xmath18 , but also on the spatial variable @xmath19 . therefore , the detected intensity is the intensity @xmath20 averaged not only over @xmath18 as in eq .\\n[ one ] , but also over the detector aperture . for simplicity , we will restrict ourselves to calculations of the intensity correlations for coinciding spatial points that correspond to `` small \\'\\' detector aperture .\\nthis simplification is quite reasonable for a long - distance propagation path of the beam .    in the case of quasimonochromatic light\\n, we can choose @xmath20 in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the creation and annihilation operators of photons with momentum @xmath24 .\\nthey are given in the heisenberg representation .\\n@xmath25 is the volume of the system .\\nit follows from eqs .\\n[ two],[three ] that @xmath26 can be obtained if one knows the average @xmath27 it is a complex problem to obtain this value for arbitrary turbulence strengths and propagation distances .\\nnevertheless , the following qualitative reasoning can help to do this in the case of strong turbulence .\\nwe have mentioned that the laser light acquires the properties of gaussian statistics in the course of its propagation through the turbulent atmosphere . as a result , in the limit of infinitely long propagation path , @xmath28 , only \\ndiagonal \" terms , i.e. terms with ( i ) @xmath29 or ( ii ) @xmath30 , @xmath31 contribute to the right part of eq .

       "   'row': {'article': 'the so - called `` nucleon spin crisis \\'\\' raised by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) measurement in 1988 is one of the most outstanding findings in the field of hadron physics @xcite,@xcite .\\nthe renaissance of the physics of high energy deep inelastic scatterings is greatly indebted to this epoch - making finding .\\nprobably , one of the most outstanding progresses achieved recently in this field of physics is the discovery and the subsequent research of completely new observables called generalized parton distribution functions ( gpd ) .\\nit has been revealed that the gpds , which can be measured through the so - called deeply - virtual compton scatterings ( dvcs ) or the deeply - virtual meson productions ( dvmp ) , contain surprisingly richer information than the standard parton distribution functions @xcite@xcite .\\nroughly speaking , the gpds are generalization of ordinary parton distributions and the elastic form factors of the nucleon .\\nthe gpds in the most general form are functions of three kinematical variables : the average longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 of the struck parton in the initial and final states , a skewdness parameter @xmath3 which measures the difference between two momentum fractions , and the four - momentum - transfer square @xmath4 of the initial and final nucleon . in the forward limit @xmath5 ,\\nsome of the gpds reduce to the usual quark , antiquark and gluon distributions .\\non the other hand , taking the @xmath0-th moment of the gpds with respect to the variable @xmath1 , one obtains the generalizations of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon , which are called the generalized form factors of the nucleon .\\nthe complex nature of the gpds , i.e. the fact that they are functions of three variable , makes it quite difficult to grasp their full characteristics both experimentally and theoretically . from the theoretical viewpoint\\n, it may be practical to begin studies with the two limiting cases .\\nthe one is the forward limit of zero momentum transfer .\\nwe have mentioned that , in this limit , some of the gpds reduce to the ordinary parton distribution function depending on one variable @xmath1 .\\nhowever , it turns out that , even in this limit , there appear some completely new distribution functions , which can not be accessed by the ordinary inclusive deep - inelastic scattering measurements .\\nvery interestingly , it was shown by ji that one of such distributions contains valuable information on the total angular momentum carried by the quark fields in the nucleon @xcite@xcite .\\nthis information , combined with the known knowledge on the longitudinal quark polarization , makes it possible to determine the quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the total nucleon spin purely experimentally .\\nanother relatively - easy - to - handle quantities are the generalized form factors of the nucleon @xcite,@xcite , which are given as the non - forward nucleon matrix elements of the spin-@xmath0 , twist - two quark and gluon operators .\\nsince these latter quantities are given as the nucleon matrix elements of local operators , they can be objects of lattice qcd simulations .\\n( it should be compared with parton distributions .\\nthe direct calculation of parton distributions is beyond the scope of lattice qcd simulations , since it needs to treat the nucleon matrix elements of quark bilinears , which are _ nonlocal in time_. ) in fact , two groups , the lhpc collaboration and the qcdsf collaboration independently investigated the generalized form factors of the nucleon , and gave several interesting predictions , which can in principle be tested by the measurement of gpds in the near future @xcite@xcite . although interesting , there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe that the predictions of these lattice simulations are realistic enough .\\nthe reason is mainly that the above mentioned lattice simulation were carried out in the heavy pion regime around @xmath6 with neglect of the so - called disconnected diagrams .\\nour real world is rather close to the chiral limit with vanishing pion mass , and we know that , in this limit , the goldstone pion plays very important roles in some intrinsic properties of the nucleon .\\nthe lattice simulation carried out in the heavy pion region is in danger of missing some important role of chiral dynamics .    on the other hand ,\\nthe chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) is an effective model of baryons , which maximally incorporates the chiral symmetry of qcd and its spontaneous breakdown @xcite,@xcite .\\n( see @xcite@xcite for early reviews . )\\nit was already applied to the physics of ordinary parton distribution functions with remarkable success @xcite@xcite . for instance , an indispensable role of pion - like quark - antiquark correlation was shown to be essential to understand the famous nmc measurement , which revealed the dominance of the @xmath7-quark over the @xmath8-quark inside the proton @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .\\nthen , it would be interesting to see what predictions the cqsm would give for the quantities mentioned above .\\nnow , the main purpose of the present study is to study the generalized form factors of the nucleon within the framework of the cqsm and compare its predictions with those of the lattice qcd simulations . of our particular interest here\\nis to see the change of final theoretical predictions against the variation of the pion mass .\\nsuch an analysis is expected to give some hints for judging the reliability of the lattice qcd predictions at the present level for the observables in question .\\nthe plan of the paper is as follows . in sect.ii\\n, we shall briefly explain how to introduce the nonzero pion mass into the scheme of the cqsm with pauli - villars regularization . in sect.iii\\n, we derive the theoretical expressions for the generalized form factors of the nucleon .\\nsect.iv is devoted to the discussion of the results of the numerical calculations .\\nsome concluding remarks are then given in sect.v .\\nwe start with the basic effective lagrangian of the chiral quark soliton model in the chiral limit given as @xmath9 with @xmath10 which describes the effective quark fields , with a dynamically generated mass @xmath11 , strongly interacting with pions @xcite,@xcite .\\nsince one of the main purposes of the present study is to see how the relevant observables depend on pion mass , we add to @xmath12 an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term @xmath13 given by @xcite @xmath14 .\\n\\\\label{eq : lsb}\\\\ ] ] here the trace in ( [ eq : lsb ] ) is to be taken with respect to flavor indices .\\nthe total model lagrangian is therefore given by @xmath15 naturally , one could have taken an alternative choice in which the explicit chiral - symmetry - breaking effect is introduced in the form of current quark mass term as @xmath16 .\\nwe did not do so , because we do not know any consistent regularization of such effective lagrangian with finite current quark mass within the framework of the pauli - villars subtraction scheme , as explained in appendix of @xcite .\\nthe effective action corresponding to the above lagrangian is given as @xmath17 = s_f [ u ] + s_m [ u ] , \\\\label{eq :

dirac gamma matrices and the flavors ( isospins ) , respectively .\\nthe fermion ( quark ) part of the above action contains ultra - violet divergences . to remove these divergences , we must introduce physical cutoffs . for the purpose of regularization , here we use the pauli - villars subtraction scheme . as explained in @xcite ,\\nwe must eliminate not only the logarithmic divergence contained in @xmath23 $ ] but also the quadratic and logarithmic divergence contained in the equation of motion shown below .\\nto get rid of all these troublesome divergence , we need at least two subtraction terms .\\nthe regularized action is thus defined as @xmath24 = s_f^{reg } [ u ] + s_m [ u ] , \\\\ ] ] where @xmath25 = s_f [ u ] - \\\\sum_{i = 1}^2 \\\\,c_i \\\\,s_f^{\\\\lambda _ i } [

logarithmic divergence contained in the equation of motion ( or in the expression of the vacuum quark condensate ) can , respectively , removed if the subtraction constants satisfy the following two conditions : @xmath29 ( we recall that the condition which removes the logarithmic divergence in @xmath23 $ ] just coincides with the 1st of the above conditions . ) by solving the above equations for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath32 which constrains the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , once @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given . for determining @xmath33 and @xmath34\\n, we use two conditions @xmath35 and @xmath36 which amounts to reproducing the correct normalization of the pion kinetic term in the effective meson lagrangian and also the empirical value of the vacuum quark condensate . to derive soliton equation of motion , we must first write down a regularized expression for the static soliton energy . under the hedgehog ansatz @xmath37 for the background pion fields ,\\nit is

@xmath59 and @xmath60 are the corresponding densities evaluated with the regulator mass @xmath28 instead of the dynamical quark mass @xmath11 .\\nwe also note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 . as usual\\n, a self - consistent soliton solution is obtained as follows with use of kahana and ripka s discretized momentum basis @xcite,@xcite .\\nfirst by assuming an appropriate ( though arbitrary ) soliton profile @xmath52 , the eigenvalue problem of the dirac hamiltonian is solved . using the resultant eigenfunctions and their associated eigenenergies\\n, one can calculate the regularized scalar and pseudoscalar densities @xmath55 and @xmath56 .\\nwith use of these @xmath63 and @xmath64 , eq.([eq : profile ] ) can then be used to obtain a new soliton profile @xmath52 .\\nthe whole procedure above is repeated with this new profile @xmath52 until the self - consistency is attained .\\nsince the generalized form factors of the nucleon are given as moments of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , it is convenient to start with the theoretical expressions of the unpolarized gpds @xmath65 and @xmath66 within the cqsm . following the notation in @xcite,@xcite\\n, we introduce the quantities @xmath67 and @xmath68 here , the isoscalar and isovector combinations respectively correspond to the sum and the difference of the quark flavors @xmath69 and @xmath70 . the relation between these quantities and the generalized parton distribution functions @xmath71 and @xmath72\\nare obtained most conveniently in the so - called breit frame .\\nthey are given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 these two independent combinations of @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be extracted through the spin projection of @xmath75 as @xmath76 where  tr \" denotes the trace over spin indices , while @xmath77 .\\nnow , within the cqsm , it is possible to evaluate the right - hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ eq : hetrace ] ) and ( [ eq : emtrace ] ) .\\nsince the answers are already given in several previous papers @xcite@xcite , we do not repeat the derivation . here\\nwe comment only on the following general structure of the theoretical expressions for relevant observables in the cqsm .\\nthe leading contribution just corresponds to the mean field prediction , which is independent of the collective rotational velocity @xmath78 of the hedgehog soliton .\\nthe next - to - leading order term takes account of the linear response of the internal quark motion to the rotational motion as an external perturbation , and consequently it is proportional to @xmath78 .\\nit is known that the leading - order term contributes to the isoscalar combination of @xmath79 and to the isovector combination of @xmath80 , while the isoscalar part of @xmath79 and the isovector part of @xmath80 survived only at the next - to - leading order of @xmath78 ( or of @xmath81 ) .\\nthe leading - order gpds are then given as @xmath82 here the symbol @xmath83 denotes the summation over the occupied ( the valence plus negative - energy dirac sea ) quark orbitals in the hedgehog mean field . on the other hand ,\\nthe theoretical expressions for the isovector part of @xmath84 and the isoscalar part of @xmath85 ,

and gluon contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon may separately vanish .\\nworthy of special mention here is an interesting argument given by teryaev some years ago , claiming that the vanishing net quark contributions to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon , violated in perturbation theory , is expected to be restored in full nonperturbative qcd due to the confinement @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . very interestingly ,\\nonce it actually happens , it leads to a surprisingly simple result , i.e. the proportionality of the quark momentum and angular

moment of the nucleon .\\n( one may notice that the prediction of the cqsm for @xmath240 underestimates a little its empirical value even in the chiral limit .\\nwe recall , however , that , within the framework of the cqsm , there is an important @xmath241 correction or the 1st order rotational correction to some kind of isovector quantities like the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon in question or the axial - vector coupling constant of the nucleon @xcite@xcite .\\nthis next - to - leading correction in @xmath241 should also be taken into account in more advanced investigations .

@xmath69-quark and the @xmath70-quark fields according to ji s angular momentum sum rule @xcite .\\nthe cqsm predicts fairly small value for this quantity , in contrast to the lattice predictions of sizable magnitude .\\nit seems that the pion mass dependence rescues this discrepancy only partially .\\nhere we argue that , the reason why the cqsm ( in the chiral limit ) gives rather small prediction for this quantity is intimately connected with the characteristic @xmath1 dependence of the quantity @xmath242 , the forward limit of the isovector unpolarized spin - flip gpd of the

and @xmath247 , respectively , as @xmath248 although the quantities of the rhs can be calculated directly without recourse to any distribution functions , they can also be evaluated as @xmath1-weighted integrals of the corresponding gpds as @xmath249 the distribution function @xmath242 has already been calculated within the cqsm in our recent paper @xcite . as shown there ,\\nthe dirac sea contribution to this quantity has a sizably large peak around @xmath250 .\\nsince this significant peak due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks is approximately symmetric with respect to the reflection @xmath251 , it hardly contributes to the second moment @xmath252 , whereas it gives a sizable contribution to the first moment @xmath253 .\\nthe predicted significant peak of @xmath242 around @xmath250 can physically be interpreted as the effects of pion cloud .\\nit can be convinced in several ways .\\nfirst , we investigate how this behavior of @xmath242 changes as the pion mass is varied .\\nobtained with @xmath182 and @xmath239.,width=340,height=264 ]     dependence of @xmath254.,width=604,height=264 ]    shown in fig.[fig : eiv_pi0 ] and in fig.[fig : eiv_pi24 ] are the cqsm predictions for @xmath242 with several values of @xmath183 .\\ni.e. @xmath255 , and @xmath256 .\\none clearly sees that the height of the peak around @xmath250 , due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks , decreases rapidly as @xmath183 increases .\\nthis supports our interpretation of this peak as the effects of pion clouds . on the other hand\\n, one also observes that the magnitude of the valence quark contribution , peaked around @xmath257 , gradually increases as @xmath183 becomes large .\\nthis behavior of @xmath242 turns out to cause a somewhat unexpected @xmath183 dependence of @xmath253 and @xmath252 . as a function of @xmath183 , the dirac sea contribution to\\n@xmath253 decreases fast , whereas the valence quark contribution to it increases slowly , so that the total @xmath253 becomes a decreasing function of @xmath183 . on the other hand ,\\nowing to the approximate odd - function nature of the dirac sea contribution to @xmath258 with respect to @xmath1 , it hardly contributes to @xmath259 independent of the pion mass , while the valence quark contribution to @xmath258 is an increasing function of @xmath183 , thereby leading to the result that the net @xmath259 is a increasing function of @xmath183 .\\nobtained with @xmath182 and @xmath239.,width=340,height=264 ]     dependence of @xmath260.,width=604,height=264 ]    we can give still another support to the above - mentioned interpretation of the contribution of the dirac - sea quarks . to see it ,\\nwe first recall that the theoretical unpolarized distribution function @xmath261 appearing in the decomposition @xmath262 also has a sizable peak around @xmath250 due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks . as shown in fig.[fig : fiv_pi0 ] and in fig.[fig : fiv_pi24 ] , this peak is again a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath183 , supporting our interpretation of it as the effects of pion clouds . here\\n, we can say more .\\nwe point out that this small-@xmath1 behavior of @xmath261 is just what is required by the famous nmc measurement @xcite . to confirm it ,\\nfirst remember that the distribution @xmath263 in the negative @xmath1 region should actually be interpreted as the distribution of antiquarks . to be explicit\\n, it holds that @xmath264 the large and positive value of @xmath261 in the negative @xmath1 region close to @xmath250 means that @xmath265 is negative , i.e. the dominance of the @xmath7-quark over the @xmath8-quark inside the proton , which has been established by the nmc measurement @xcite\\n.     evolved to @xmath266 and @xmath267 in comparison with the hermes and nutev data at the corresponding energy scales @xcite,@xcite.,width=340,height=283 ]    shown in fig.[fig : dbdu ] are the predictions of the cqsm for @xmath268 evolved to the high energy scales corresponding to the experimental observation @xcite .\\n( the theoretical predictions here were obtained with @xmath182 and @xmath269 . )\\nthe model reproduces well the observed behavior of @xmath268 , although the magnitude of the flavor asymmetry in smaller @xmath1 region seems to be slightly overestimated .\\nit is a widely accepted fact that this flavor asymmetry of the sea quark distribution in the proton can physically be understood as the effects of pion cloud at least qualitatively @xcite@xcite .\\nthis then supports our interpretation of the effects of the deformed dirac - sea quarks in @xmath242 and @xmath261 as the effects of pion clouds .    .the\\n@xmath270 dependencies of @xmath271 , @xmath272 , and @xmath273 in the cqsm with @xmath182 .\\n[ tabivb20 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]\\nin this paper , we have investigated the generalized form factors of the nucleon , which will be extracted through near - future measurements of the generalized parton distribution functions , within the framework of the cqsm .\\na particular emphasis is put on the pion mass dependence as well as the scale dependence of the model predictions , which we compare with the corresponding predictions of the lattice qcd by the lhpc and the qcdsf collaborations carried out in the heavy pion regime around @xmath199 .\\nthe generalized form factors contain the ordinary electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon such as the dirac and pauli form factors of the proton and the neutron .\\nwe have shown that the cqsm with good chiral symmetry reproduces well the general behaviors of the observed electromagnetic form factors , while the lattice simulations by the above two groups have a tendency to underestimate the electromagnetic sizes of the nucleon . undoubtedly , this can not be unrelated to the fact that the above two lattice simulations were performed with unrealistically heavy pion mass .\\nwe have also tried to figure out the underlying spin contents of the nucleon through the analysis of the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic form factors of the nucleon , by taking care of the pion mass despondencies as well as of the scale dependencies of the relevant quantities . after taking account of the scale dependencies by means of the qcd evolution equations at the nlo in the @xmath274 scheme ,\\nthe cqsm predicts , at @xmath275 , that @xmath276 , and @xmath277 , which means that the quark orbital angular momentum carries sizable amount of total nucleon spin even at such a relatively high energy scale .\\nit contradicts the conclusion of the lhpc and qcdsf collaborations indicating that the total orbital angular momentum of quarks is very small or consistent with zero .\\nit should be recognized , however , that the prediction of the cqsm for the total quark angular momentum is not extremely far from the corresponding lattice prediction @xmath278 at the same renormalization scale .\\nthe cause of discrepancy can therefore be traced back to the lhpc and qcdsf lattice qcd predictions for the quark spin fraction @xmath279 around 0.6 , which contradicts not only the prediction of the cqsm but also the emc observation . as was shown in our recent paper @xcite , @xmath279 is such a quantity that is extremely sensitive to the variation of the pion mass , especially in the region close to the chiral limit .\\nmore serious lattice qcd studies on the @xmath270-dependence of @xmath279 is highly desirable .\\nworthy of special mention is the fact that , once we accept a theoretical postulate @xmath280 , i.e , the absence of the net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon , which is supported by both of the lhpc and qcdsf lattice simulations , we are necessarily led to a surprisingly simple relations , @xmath281 and @xmath282 , i.e. the proportionality of the linear and angular momentum fractions carried by the quarks and the gluons . using these relations , together with the existing empirical information for the unpolarized and the longitudinally polarized pdfs\\n, we can give _ model - independent predictions _ for the quark and gluon contents of the nucleon spin .\\nfor instance , with combined use of the mrst2004 fit @xcite and the dns2005 fit @xcite , we obtain @xmath283 , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 at @xmath275 . since @xmath286 ( as well as @xmath287 ) is a rapidly decreasing function of the energy scale , while the scale dependence of @xmath279 is very weak\\n, we must conclude that the former is even more dominant over the latter at the scale below @xmath288 where any low energy models are supposed to hold .\\nthe situation is a little more complicated in the flavor - nonsinglet ( or isovector ) channel , because @xmath289 , and also because the cqsm and the lattice qcd give fairly different predictions for @xmath271 . as compared with the lattice prediction for @xmath271 around @xmath290 , the predictions of the cqsm turns out to be around @xmath291 .\\nwe have argued that the relatively small value of @xmath246 obtained in the cqsm is intimately connected with the small @xmath1 enhancement of the generalized parton distribution @xmath292 , which is dominated by the clouds of pionic @xmath293 excitation around @xmath294 .\\n( we recall that the 2nd moment of @xmath292 gives @xmath246 . )\\nunfortunately , such a @xmath1-dependent distribution as @xmath292 can not be accessed within the framework of lattice qcd .\\nstill , the predicted small @xmath1 behavior of @xmath295 as well as of @xmath296 indicates again the importance of chiral dynamics in the nucleon structure function physics , which has not been fully accounted for in the lattice qcd simulation at the present level .\\nthis work is supported in part by a grant - in - aid for scientific research for ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology , japan ( no .  c-16540253 )\\nhere we closely follow the proof of the momentum sum rule given in @xcite , by taking into account a necessary modification in the case of @xmath297 .\\nthe starting point is the following expression for the soliton mass ( or the static soliton energy ) : @xmath298   \\\\ - \\\\ ( h \\\\rightarrow h_0 ) \\\\ + \\\\\\ne_m , \\\\ ] ] with @xmath299 \\\\ = \\\\ - \\\\,f_\\\\pi^2 \\\\,m_\\\\pi^2 \\\\,\\\\int \\\\ , [

boundary condition @xmath309 we can manipulate as @xmath310 we thus find an important relation : @xmath311 putting this relation into ( [ eq : keyid ] ) , we have @xmath312 or @xmath313 if we evaluate the trace sum above by using the eigenstates of the static dirac hamiltonian @xmath50 as a complete set of basis , ( [ eq : traceap ] ) can also be written as @xmath314 which is the relation quoted in ( [ eq : alfp ] ) .\\nwe point out that our result has a correct chiral limit , since @xmath315 as @xmath316 and therefore @xmath317 in conformity with the proof given in ref.@xcite .',\n",

@xmath384 , which improves slightly upon the value @xmath60 from @xcite .\\nhowever , as remarked in @xcite , the upper bound @xmath385 ensuring and hence the validity of theorem  [
